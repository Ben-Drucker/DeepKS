Site information file. Must be able to be read as JSON. Structure must be:

    {
        "<site sequence 1>": {
            "Uniprot Accession ID": [<list of associated site Uniprot Accession IDs>],
            "Gene Name": [<list of associated site gene names>],
            "Location": [<list of phosphorylation locations for this site>]
        },
        "<site sequence 2>": {
            "Uniprot Accession ID": [<list of associated site Uniprot Accession IDs>],
            "Gene Name": [<list of associated site gene names>],
            "Location": [<list of phosphorylation locations for this site>]
        },
        .
        .
        .
    }

For example, the following is a valid site information file:

    "AYGEKEHCANCHNIV": {
        "Uniprot Accession ID": ["SITE-ID1"],
        "Gene Name": ["SITE-GN1"],
        "Location": ["S1"]
    },
    "CHEFIPAKIPTNNIS": {
        "Uniprot Accession ID": ["SITE-ID2", "SITE-ID2-SIMILAR"],
        "Gene Name": ["SITE-GN2", "SITE-GN2-SIMILAR"],
        "Location": ["S2", "S345"]
    },
    "MKNMWMPMHWELTGC": {
        "Uniprot Accession ID": ["SITE-ID3"],
        "Gene Name": ["SITE-GN3"],
        "Location": ["S3", "S42", "S99"]
    },
